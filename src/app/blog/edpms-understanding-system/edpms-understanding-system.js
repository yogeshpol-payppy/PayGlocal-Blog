                  The Export Data Processing and Monitoring System (EDPMS) is an
                  online platform introduced by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI)
                  in 2014. This system plays a critical role in the reporting
                  and regulation of export activities, providing a structured
                  framework for Indian banks to document these transactions. By
                  enhancing the transparency of dollar dealings between India
                  and international markets, EDPMS significantly contributes to
                  the integrity of the country&apos;s trade practices.

                      Revenue Intelligence (DRI), and Enforcement Directorate

                    <span className="large-card-body text-[#1a1a1a]">
                      Banks have the authority to approve reductions in invoice
                      values when exporters present genuine reasons, such as
                      errors, discrepancies, or post-shipment adjustments. This
                      flexibility helps maintain accurate records while
                      accommodating real-world business scenarios.

                    <span className="large-card-body text-[#1a1a1a]">
                      The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) can grant extensions for
                      the realization of export proceeds when exporters face
                      unavoidable delays. These extensions ensure that
                      businesses have sufficient time to collect payments
                      without facing penalties, supporting smoother
                      international trade operations.

                    <span className="large-card-body text-[#1a1a1a]">
                      In cases where export proceeds cannot be realized, there
                      are established procedures that allow for the write-off of
                      export bills. This process is crucial for clearing
                      non-receivable accounts from the books and maintaining
                      accurate financial records.

                      Exporters are permitted to self-write-off export bills
                      under certain conditions, provided they obtain a
                      certificate from a Chartered Accountant (CA). This option
                      offers a streamlined approach for exporters to manage
                      uncollectible export receivables without needing prior
                      approval from the RBI or banks.

                      When using the self-write-off process, the CA certificate
                      must include specific details such as:
