                                        Efficient management of foreign exchange earnings is crucial for exporters, and one avenue available to them is the Exchange Earner&apos;s Foreign Currency (EEFC) account. In this article, we will delve into what an EEFC account is, the benefits it offers, limitations, alternative solutions, and ultimately, the importance of having an EEFC account.

This account allows exporters to hold multiple foreign currencies without the need for conversion into Indian Rupees immediately. An EEFC account is essentially a form of current account that can receive non-INR currencies.
