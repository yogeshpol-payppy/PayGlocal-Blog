                <h5>India’s Role in Global Trade</h5>
                <p>
                  India’s export industry, spanning a diverse array of sectors,
                  has become a global powerhouse, contributing substantially to
                  both GDP and employment. As per the Ministry of Commerce and
                  Industry, India’s exports reached an impressive $261.47
                  billion by July 2024, marking a 6.65% increase over the
                  previous year. This boom isn’t just about numbers; it reflects
                  India’s growing influence on the world stage, from consumer
                  goods to essential industrial supplies. Key products such as
                  refined petroleum, which fuels economies worldwide, exemplify
                  the scale of India’s industrial output. In contrast,
                  handcrafted gems and jewellery emphasize India’s craftsmanship
                  and have garnered admiration in luxury markets globally.
                </p>

                  This thriving sector also includes pharmaceuticals,
                  reinforcing India’s title as the “pharmacy of the world” with
                  exports that supply critical medicines and vaccines to
                  countries across continents. Meanwhile, textiles and tea—a nod
                  to traditional Indian exports—continue to thrive, catering to
                  both niche and mass markets. The variety in India’s export
                  portfolio—from machines and chemicals to dairy and
                  automobiles—reflects a nation seamlessly balancing
                  technological progress with deep-rooted cultural expertise,
                  marking India as an indispensable partner in global trade.

                  both developed and emerging markets and drives global economic
                  growth. Moreover, India’s focus on sustainable and
                  technology-driven exports shapes international trade policies
                  and market trends. Initiatives such as FTP 2024 aim to further
                  facilitate foreign trade, particularly through e-commerce
                  platforms.

                      maintain resilience in exports despite these headwinds,
                      with particular strength in sectors like agriculture and
                      pharmaceuticals, which are seeing consistent demand.
                      Keeping up with these demands requires continuous
                      adaptation and an emphasis on quality, which may strain
                      resources, especially for small and medium exporters.

                  India is focusing on a diversified export strategy to steer
                  through the budding requirements. Key industries are being
                  encouraged to adopt sustainable practices, and government
                  support through export credit and quality assurance
                  initiatives is increasingly vital. Programs such as the Export
                  Credit Guarantee Corporation (ECGC) insurance and specific
                  export schemes aim to mitigate risk and safeguard against
                  currency or compliance-related disruptions, ensuring that
                  exporters can pursue growth opportunities while meeting global
                  standards.
