                <h4>Understanding the Liability Shift</h4>
                <h5>Definition and Context</h5>The liability shift refers to the transfer of responsibility for fraudulent transactions from one party to another. Historically, card issuers, such as banks, bore the brunt of fraud-related costs. However, with advancements in payment security technologies like EMV (Europay, Mastercard, and Visa) chips and 3D Secure, this responsibility can shift to the party that has not implemented the appropriate security measures.
                <br/>
                    
                <h5>Types of Liability Shifts</h5>

                <h4>Impact of the Liability Shift on Merchants</h4>
                <h5>Pre-Shift vs. Post-Shift</h5>Before the liability shift, card issuers were primarily responsible for fraudulent transactions. Merchants could use older magnetic stripe technology without facing severe repercussions for fraud. Post-shift, the scenario changed dramatically. If a fraudulent transaction occurs and the merchant has not used 3DSecure protocol, the merchant or acquirer is liable for the fraud.
                <br/>
                <h5>CNP Fraud: Where EMV Liability Falls Short</h5>If your business primarily focuses on in-store sales, adopting EMV chip cards will undoubtedly lower your risk and liability for fraud. The tokenization technology used in EMV chips is challenging for fraudsters to hack or spoof. Even if a fraudster possesses the physical card, it is nearly useless without the PIN code.
            
            <p>However, eCommerce merchants face a different reality. According to the Federal Trade Commission, while EMV adoption significantly reduced in-person fraud, online credit card fraud more than doubled between 2019 and 2020. Globally, fraudsters have shifted their activities online, where there are fewer safeguards in place to prevent fraud.</p>

                <h4>Multi-Layered Fraud Prevention </h4>
                <p className="large-card-body text-[#1a1a1a]">
                To tackle the rising threat of CNP fraud, eCommerce merchants need to implement a multi-layered approach to fraud prevention. Here are some effective strategies:
                </p>
                <ol style={{ listStyleType: "number" }}>
                    <li><span>3D Secure Authentication:</span> Implementing 3D Secure (e.g., Verified by Visa, Mastercard SecureCode) adds an additional layer of security by requiring customers to complete an additional verification step during the checkout process. This can significantly reduce the risk of fraudulent transactions.</li>
                    <li><span>Fraud Detection Tools:</span> Use advanced fraud detection tools that employ machine learning and artificial intelligence to identify suspicious behavior in real-time. These tools can analyze transaction patterns and flag potentially fraudulent activities for further review.</li>
                    <li><span>Tokenization:</span> Tokenization replaces sensitive card information with a unique identifier (token) that cannot be used outside the specific transaction. This helps protect card details from being intercepted during online transactions.</li>
                    <li><span>Address Verification Service (AVS):</span> AVS checks the billing address provided by the customer against the address on file with the card issuer. This can help identify and prevent fraudulent transactions where the billing address does not match. Note that AVS works only in select markets and using it wisely is key to extract the maximum benefits out of this service.</li>
                    <li><span>Card Verification Value (CVV):</span> Require customers to enter the CVV code from the back of their card during the transaction. For international cards, many issuers approve transactions even if CVV is wrong and hence additional due diligence is required to find if a transaction was a “hard” decline or a “soft” decline and take a decision.</li>
                    <li><span>Behavioral Analytics:</span> Behavioral analytics monitor and analyze the behavior of users on your site. This can help detect anomalies and potential fraud based on how users interact with the site.</li>
                </ol>
              </div>
              

                
              
              <div className="blog-section">
                <h4>The Role of Payment Service Providers (PSPs) </h4>
                <h5>What PSPs Offer</h5>Not many PSPs today offer a range of integrated fraud and payment processing services designed to enhance payment security and simplify transaction processing. They provide simpler fraud tools such as a rule engine to use velocity checks but forget that it is easy for fraudsters to identify how to work around these rules and carry on to their fraud business.
                <p>Select PSPs in the market bundle fraud prevention and payment processing such that merchants and acquiring banks can sleep a peaceful night. These modern age PSPs offer fraud as a core part of their offering as they cater to merchants who accept payments from their global customers and these customers come from.</p>
                <h5>Fraud Detection and Prevention</h5>Modern PSPs employ sophisticated fraud detection algorithms, machine learning, and real-time monitoring to identify and block suspicious transactions. Tools like device fingerprinting, smart orchestration that decides regional processing attributes, behavioural analytics, smartly using 3D Secure authentication, address verification services (AVS), and card verification value (CVV) checks helps them mitigate risks and protect merchants.
                <h5>Benefits of Using a Credible PSP</h5>Choosing a reputable PSP brings long-term advantages. Enhanced fraud protection reduces the risk of chargebacks, while excellent customer support ensures smooth operation and quick resolution of issues. Additionally, a credible PSP can help you stay compliant with evolving security standards.
                <h5>PayGlocal&apos;s Fraud Detection Software</h5>PayGlocal offers a state-of-the-art fraud detection solution designed to protect merchants from fraudulent transactions. Our software utilizes advanced algorithms and real-time monitoring to identify suspicious activities, ensuring that your business remains secure and compliant.
