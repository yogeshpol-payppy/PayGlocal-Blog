                <h4>Factors to consider while choosing a payment method</h4>
                <ol style={{ listStyleType: "decimal" }}>
                  <li>
                    <span>Coverage:</span> Does the payment method support
                    transfers to the geographies of your choice.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <span>Costs:</span> The cost of international transfers
                    varies for each method. The costs could include conversion
                    costs, processing fees, account opening and maintenance
                    charges and so on.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <span>Speed (transaction time):</span> The urgency of
                    transfer also factors into the choice of payment modes. Some
                    methods offer near instant transfer times while others may
                    take 3-5 business days.{" "}

                <h4>Bank or Wire Transfers </h4>
                <p className="large-card-body text-[#1a1a1a]">
                  Bank or write transfers are a standard method used by Indian
                  businesses for international money transfers. These are
                  bank-to-bank transactions through SWIFT rails.
                </p>
                <p className="large-card-body text-[#1a1a1a]">
                  Costs and fees vary between banks and may include transaction
                  fees, intermediary bank charges, and currency conversion fees.
                  Bank transfers are generally reliable, although speed can vary
                  depending on the destination and correspondent banks involved.
                </p>
                <p className="large-card-body text-[#1a1a1a]">
                  Advantages of bank transfers include wide acceptance, the
                  ability to transfer large amounts, and recurring payment
                  options. However, bank transfers may have higher fees compared
                  to other methods, and the speed of transfers may not always be
                  immediate.

                <h4>Cards </h4>
                <p className="large-card-body text-[#1a1a1a]">
                  Cards are a common and prevalent mode of payment in todayâ€™s
                  economy, even for international money transfers. Cards, such
                  as corporate debit or credit cards, provide businesses with a
                  convenient and efficient method to transfer funds
                  internationally.
                </p>
                <p className="large-card-body text-[#1a1a1a]">
                  Cards are widely accepted and ensure swift transactions and
                  accessibility of funds, but businesses may be subject to less
                  favorable exchange rates compared to other payment methods.

                <h4>Digital Payment Methods </h4>
                <p className="large-card-body text-[#1a1a1a]">
                  Digital payment platforms like PayPal, Wise etc., have gained
                  popularity among Indian businesses for international money
                  transfers. They can be further categorized as digital wallets
                  and payment processing platforms.
                </p>
                <p className="large-card-body text-[#1a1a1a]">
                  Costs and fees typically include transaction fees and currency
                  conversion charges. These platforms often offer competitive
                  rates and fees compared to traditional banks. Transfer speeds
                  can range from a few minutes to a few days, depending on the
                  destination and platform used.
                </p>
                <p className="large-card-body text-[#1a1a1a]">
                  Advantages of digital payment platforms include convenience,
                  user-friendly interfaces, faster transfer times compared to
                  bank transfers, and the ability to send money to individuals
                  or businesses worldwide. However, businesses should ensure
                  that the platform is widely accepted in the recipient&apos;s
                  country and may need to comply with platform-specific
                  limitations or verification requirements.

                <h4>Conclusion </h4>
                <p className="large-card-body text-[#1a1a1a]">
                  Wire transfers are widely accepted but can be relatively
                  expensive. Bank transfers offer reliability but may come with
                  higher fees too. Digital payment platforms are convenient and
                  cost-effective, but businesses must take care that it gives
                  them the necessary coverage and reliability.
