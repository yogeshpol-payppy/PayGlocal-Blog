                  Maneuvering India’s <a href="https://www.gst.gov.in/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Goods and Services Tax (GST)</a> system can be a daunting task for businesses, especially when it comes to categorizing products and services. At the heart of this framework are two essential codes: <a href="https://services.gst.gov.in/services/searchhsnsac" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">HSN (Harmonized System of Nomenclature)</a> and <a href="https://tax2win.in/guide/sac-codes-for-services" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">SAC (Service Accounting Code)</a>.
                </p>
                <p>But why are these codes so important? These codes form the foundation of how goods and services are classified, ensuring that every transaction is accurately taxed under the GST regime. By assigning a unique identifier to each product or service, HSN and SAC codes help businesses categorize their offerings and maintain compliance with the law. Understanding these codes isn&apos;t just a legal necessity—it’s a business imperative.  </p>
                <p>In this blog, we’ll explore the origins, structure, and purpose of both SAC and HSN codes, shedding light on how they differ, why they matter, and how they can simplify your business’s tax processes. </p>

              </div>
              <div className="blog-section">
                <h5>Purpose and Origin: Why Do We Need SAC and HSN Codes? </h5>
                <p>Ever wondered how services and goods are classified under India’s Goods and Services Tax (GST)? The answer lies in two key classification systems: SAC and HSN Codes. These codes were developed to streamline GST procedures and simplify tax identification. </p>
                <p>Let’s break down their origins and purpose: </p>
                <ol style={{ listStyleType: "disc" }}>
                  <li><p>SAC (Service Accounting Code):</p>
                    <ol style={{ listStyleType: "disc" }}>
                      <li>Specifically designed for classifying services. </li>
                      <li>Used solely for services such as banking, transportation, and IT. </li>
                    </ol>
                  </li>
                  <li><p>HSN (Harmonized System of Nomenclature):</p>
                    <ol style={{ listStyleType: "disc" }}>
                      <li>Globally recognized system, first adopted by India in 1971 as part of its membership in the <a href="https://www.wcoomd.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">World Customs Organization (WCO).</a> </li>
                      <li>Initially used for Customs and Central Excise classification with a 6-digit format since 1986. </li>
                      <li>With the introduction of GST in 2017, India adopted a 3-tier system, extending HSN codes to 8 digits for further differentiation of goods. </li>
                    </ol>
                  </li>
                </ol>
                <p>Both systems share the common goal of ensuring proper identification and streamlining tax filings, allowing businesses to remain compliant with GST requirements. </p>
              </div>
              <div className="blog-section">
                <p>Now that we know the purpose behind these codes, let’s take a closer look at their structure:  </p>
                <h5>Numerical Structure: How Are SAC and HSN Codes Organized? </h5>
                <p>Numbers play a crucial role in simplifying these complex systems. How are SAC and HSN codes formatted, and what makes their numerical patterns distinct from each other? Let’s figure it out: </p>
                <ol style={{ listStyleType: "disc" }}>
                  <li><p><a href="https://razorpay.com/learn/hsn-sac-code-full-form-meaning-explained/#:~:text=SAC%20codes%20are%20six%20digits,two%20for%20the%20sub%2Dservice." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">SAC Codes:</a></p>
                    <ol style={{ listStyleType: "disc" }}>
                      <li>Typically SAC Codes consist of 6 digits, with each level specifying a more detailed service classification. </li>
                      <li>The system offers a finer breakdown of services, making it easier for businesses to classify what they offer accurately </li>
                      <li>All service codes start with the number 99. Consequently, the SAC code system is used to classify, identify, and determine the applicability of GST on services in India. </li>
                    </ol>
                  </li>
                  <li><p><a href="https://www.tradefinanceglobal.com/customs/what-is-an-hsn-code/#:~:text=The%20structure%20of%20HSN%20code,subsequently%20divided%20into%205224%20subheadings." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"> HSN Codes:</a></p>
                    <ol style={{ listStyleType: "disc" }}>
                      <li>The HSN code is organized into sections, which are further divided into chapters. Each chapter is then broken down into separate headings, and these headings are further classified into subheadings. </li>
                      <li><p>The HSN code consists of: </p>
                        <ol style={{ listStyleType: "disc" }}>
                          <li>21 sections </li>

                          <li> 99 chapters</li>

                          <li>1,244 headings</li>

                          <li>5,224 subheadings</li>
                        </ol>
                      </li>
                    </ol>
                  </li>
                </ol>
                <p>In summary, the SAC code has a total of 6 digits, under the GST framework, while the HSN codes can range from 4, 6, to 8 digits, depending on the turnover of the business and the types of goods involved. </p>
