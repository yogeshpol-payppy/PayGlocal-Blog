                  International payment standards and infrastructure hasnâ€™t
                  evolved enough to meet the growing needs of global sales and
                  transactions. Adding into the mix different local banking
                  standards, payment methods, currency conversion, and payment
                  chain gets longer and more complicated.

                  So, without proper payment processes and strategies in place,
                  your payment acceptance rate and by extension, revenue take a
                  hit. It is critical that businesses accepting payments from
                  around the world take this seriously. One transaction decline
                  not only leads to loss of that sale but in most cases, loss of
                  that customer itself due to bad experience faced by them.

                  Businesses rarely have the infrastructure or the means to make
                  the above happen. The solution is to work with payment
                  service/infrastructure providers that understand how to
                  process global transactions the way they should be processed
                  in different geographies. These entities have a high volume of
                  transactions since they work with several businesses and
                  understand how each transaction must be treated for getting
                  that approval that matters to the merchants.

                  We&apos;ve established that banks decline transactions if they
                  look risky. By changing the persona of a transaction to make
                  it look more like a domestic transaction, PayGlocal increases
                  the approval rates from the banks without burdening the
                  customers. Our internal risk assessment engine runs data from
                  several touchpoints to assess every transaction, thus
                  processing authentic transactions and blocking fraudulent
                  ones.
