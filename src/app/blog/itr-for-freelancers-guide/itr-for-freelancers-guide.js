                  Freelancing, under the Income Tax Act, is considered a

                <h4>Steps Involved in Filing ITR for Freelancers</h4>
                <h5>Step 1: Calculate Gross Annual Income</h5>
                <p className="large-card-body text-[#1a1a1a]">
                  Begin by calculating your total income from all freelancing
                  activities throughout the financial year i.e., from 1st April
                  to 31st March. This includes payments received from clients
                  for services rendered, as well as any additional income
                  generated from freelance-related activities. Ensure that you
                  account for all income sources to avoid discrepancies during
                  tax filing.
                </p>

                <h5>Step 2: Assess Eligible Expenses and Deductions</h5>
                <p className="large-card-body text-[#1a1a1a]">
                  Identify business-related expenses that qualify as deductions.
                  Common eligible expenses include travel costs, office rent,
                  utilities, equipment purchases, and any other costs directly
                  associated with running your freelance business. By deducting
                  these expenses from your gross income, you reduce your taxable
                  income, thus lowering your tax liability.
                </p>

                <h5>Step 3: Choose the Relevant ITR Form (ITR-3 or ITR-4)</h5>
                <p className="large-card-body text-[#1a1a1a]">
                  Selecting the correct Income Tax Return (ITR) form is
                  essential. Freelancers typically choose between ITR-3 and
                  ITR-4, depending on their income structure and tax regime.
                </p>

                <h5>Step 4: Register on the Income Tax e-Filing Portal</h5>
                <p className="large-card-body text-[#1a1a1a]">
                  If you haven’t already, register on the Income Tax
                  Department’s e-Filing portal. This platform is where you’ll
                  submit your tax returns online. Registration requires basic
                  details like your PAN (Permanent Account Number), name, and
                  date of birth. Once registered, you can access various online
                  tax services, including filing your ITR.
                </p>

                <h5>Step 5: Submit the Filled Form and Verify Your ITR</h5>
                <p className="large-card-body text-[#1a1a1a]">
                  After selecting the appropriate ITR form, fill it out with
                  accurate financial details, including income, deductions, and
                  taxes paid. Double-check for accuracy before submitting it
                  electronically. After submission, it’s crucial to verify your
                  ITR. Verification can be done through various methods, such as
                  Aadhaar OTP, net banking, or sending a signed physical copy to
                  the Centralized Processing Center (CPC) in Bengaluru.

                  Filing ITR for freelancers in India involves several crucial
