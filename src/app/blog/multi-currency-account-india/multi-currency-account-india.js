                <p className="large-card-body text-[#1a1a1a]">
                  A multi-currency account as the name suggests is a bank
                  account that allows you to manage your funds in multiple
                  currencies in a single account, globally. This means you can
                  make international transactions without the need to open a
                  separate account in each currency or go through the hassle of
                  currency conversion.
                </p>
                <p className="large-card-body text-[#1a1a1a]">
                  Depending on the provider, you can hold currencies such as US
                  dollars, Euros, British pounds, and more. You can also make
                  deposits and withdrawals in these currencies, as well as
                  convert currencies at competitive rates.

                  A multi-currency account allows the account holder to transact
                  in different countries like a local entity. So, the main
                  benefit of a multi-currency account is the convenience it
                  provides for international transactions.
