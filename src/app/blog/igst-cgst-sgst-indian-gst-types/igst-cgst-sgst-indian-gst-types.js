                  How does India’s Goods and Services Tax (GST) work across different transactions? And how does it impact businesses both within and outside state borders? Let&apos;s begin by understanding the core structure of GST, a unified tax system that streamlines India&apos;s intricate taxation scenario.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The introduction of GST in India revolutionized the country’s tax system. Implemented on 1st July 2017, it aimed to simplify the tax structure by combining multiple indirect taxes into a single framework, offering a more efficient way to manage and comply with tax obligations. But what are the different types of GST, and how do they apply to various transactions?
                </p>
                <p>There are 4 types of GST in India, they are: </p>
                <ol style={{ listStyleType: "decimal" }}>
                  <li>CGST (Central Goods and Services Tax) </li>
                  <li>SGST (State Goods and Services)</li>
                  <li>IGST (Integrated Goods and Services Tax) </li>
                  <li>UTGST (Union Territory Goods and Services Tax)</li>
                </ol>
                <p>This blog helps you understand the different types of GST —CGST, SGST, IGST, and UTGST along with their roles in different scenarios of Finance. </p>
              </div>
              <div className="blog-section">
                <p>Let’s explore the central component of GST, CGST, which plays a key role in transactions within state borders. Here&apos;s how it works: </p>
                <h5>Central Goods and Services Tax (CGST) </h5>
                <p>CGST is levied by the central government on intrastate transactions (sales within the same state). When you make a sale or purchase within the same state, CGST is charged along with SGST. </p>
                <p><span>Key Aspects: </span></p>
                <ol style={{ listStyleType: "disc" }}>
                  <li><p><span>Levied by:</span> Central Government</p></li>
                  <li><p><span>Applicability:</span> Only on intrastate transactions (within the same state) </p></li>
                  <li><p><span>Example: </span></p>
                    <ol style={{ listStyleType: "disc" }}>
                      <li><p><span>Sale price of goods:</span> ₹1000</p> </li>
                      <li><p><span>CGST rate:</span> 9%</p> </li>
                      <li><p><span>CGST =</span> ₹1000 × 9% = ₹90</p> </li>
                    </ol>
                  </li>
                </ol>
                <p>In this example, if the SGST is also 9%, the total GST charged will be ₹180. </p>
              </div>
              <div className="blog-section">
                <p>Alongside CGST, SGST ensures the state government gets its share. Let’s explore its function in local trade: </p>
                <h5>State Goods and Services Tax (SGST) </h5>
                <p>SGST is imposed by the state government on intrastate sales (transactions within the same state), alongside CGST. This ensures that both the central and state governments receive their share of the tax. </p>
                <p><span>Key Aspects: </span></p>
                <ol style={{ listStyleType: "disc" }}>
                  <li><p><span>Levied by:</span> State Government</p> </li>
                  <li><p><span>Applicability:</span> Only on intrastate transactions</p> </li>
                  <li><p><span>Example: </span></p>
                    <ol style={{ listStyleType: "disc" }}>
                      <li><p><span>Sale price of goods:</span> ₹1000 </p> </li>
                      <li><p><span> SGST rate:</span> 9% </p></li>
                      <li><p><span>SGST =</span> ₹1000 × 9% = ₹90</p> </li>
                    </ol>
                  </li>
                </ol>
                <p>In intrastate transactions, both CGST and SGST apply, as shown in the previous example. </p>

                <p>When businesses cross state lines, IGST comes into play. Here&apos;s how it manages interstate and international transactions. </p>
              </div>
              <div className="blog-section">
                <h5>Integrated Goods and Services Tax (IGST) </h5>
                <p>What happens when goods or services move across state borders? IGST applies to interstate transactions (when the transaction happens between two different states) or international trade. IGST ensures a smooth flow of goods across state borders without duplication of tax. </p>
                <p><span>Key Aspects: </span></p>

                  </li>
                </ol>
                <p>IGST is collected by the central government and then shared with the state where the goods are ultimately consumed. </p>

                <p>In Union Territories, UTGST replaces SGST. Let’s dive into its application to learn more: </p>
                <h5>Union Territory Goods and Services Tax (UTGST) </h5>
                <p>UTGST is similar to SGST but applies in Union Territories (UTs) where there is no state government. It is levied at the same rate as CGST to ensure similar tax administration in both states and union territories. </p>

                <ol style={{ listStyleType: "disc" }}>

                  <li><p><span>Applicability:</span>   For transactions within Union Territories   </p></li>
                  <li><p><span>Example: </span></p>

                  </li>
                </ol>
                <p>Just like CGST and SGST, UTGST is applied to intrastate transactions within Union Territories. </p>

              <div className="blog-section">
                <p>Each GST type applies in specific scenarios. Let’s break down when and where these taxes are implemented: </p>
                <h5>Application of Different GST Types </h5>
                <p>Let’s dive deeper into how these GST types work with real-life examples to make things clearer: </p>
                <h5>Intrastate Transaction Example (CGST and SGST): </h5>
                <p>If a business in Maharashtra sells goods worth ₹1,00,000 to a customer within Maharashtra, both CGST and SGST will apply at 9% each (assuming an 18% GST rate). Here&apos;s how the calculation works: </p>
                <ol style={{ listStyleType: "disc" }}>
                  <li><p><span>Total Sale Value: </span> ₹1,00,000 </p></li>
                  <li><p><span>CGST (9%):</span>  ₹9,000 </p></li>
                  <li><p><span>SGST (9%):</span>  ₹9,000 </p></li>
                  <li><p><span>Total Tax Collected:</span> ₹18,000 </p></li>
                </ol>
                <p>In this case, ₹9,000 goes to the central government, and ₹9,000 goes to the Maharashtra state government. This is how taxes are distributed under intrastate transactions, ensuring both governments receive their share. </p>
                <h5>Interstate Transaction Example (IGST): </h5>
                <p>Let’s consider an interstate transaction where a company in Maharashtra sells goods to a customer in Karnataka for ₹2,00,000. IGST applies here instead of CGST and SGST because the goods are moving between states. Assuming an 18% tax rate, the calculation is as follows: </p>
                <ol style={{ listStyleType: "disc" }}>
                  <li><p><span>Total Sale Value: </span> ₹2,00,000 </p></li>
                  <li><p><span>IGST (18%):</span>  ₹36,000  </p></li>
                  <li><p><span>Total Tax Collected:</span> ₹36,000 </p></li>
                </ol>
                <p>In this case, the entire tax amount of ₹36,000 is collected as IGST, which the central government later divides between Maharashtra and Karnataka. </p>
