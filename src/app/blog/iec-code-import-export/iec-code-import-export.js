                  At its core, the IEC is your business&apos;s passport to the
                  global market. The IEC is a unique 10-digit code issued by the
                  Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT) under the Ministry
                  of Commerce and Industry, Government of India. It&apos;s like
                  your business&apos;s identification for all things related to
                  importing and exporting. Whether you&apos;re clearing goods at
                  customs or conducting international trade transactions, having
                  an IEC code is a mandatory requirement that cannot be
                  overlooked.

                      It simplifies the process, allowing you to focus on

                      An IEC ensures that your cross-border transactions are

                      penalties or issues with authorities.
