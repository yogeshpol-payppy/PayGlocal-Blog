                  Businesses today can seize exciting opportunities to scale
                  internationally, tap into new markets and grow their revenue.
                  But it&apos;s far from easy to do so efficiently and
                  effectively. Payments is an important part of this growth
                  equation. Companies expanding into new markets can attest to
                  this.

                <p className="large-card-body text-[#1a1a1a]">
                  In this article, we will explore the types of costs associated
                  with international transactions, the factors affecting these
                  costs, and why businesses need reliable and scalable payment
                  processing.

                <p className="large-card-body text-[#1a1a1a]">
                  Consider that your business is receiving an amount of $1000
                  from across borders for goods or services delivered. A money
                  transfer service, a bank or a payment provider advertises the
                  cost of transfer to be anywhere from $25 to $30. But the
                  transaction typically costs the receiver much more than that.{" "}

                  anywhere between 0.3% to 20% of the transaction amount. At 10%

                <h4>The importance of understanding hidden charges </h4>
                <p className="large-card-body text-[#1a1a1a]">
                  Evident from the above example, hidden charges can
                  significantly impact the final amount received by the
                  beneficiary. These hidden fees, if not carefully monitored,
                  can erode your transfer amount and result in unexpected
                  expenses. Therefore, being aware of and understanding these
                  hidden charges is of utmost importance to make cost-effective
                  and informed financial decisions.
                </p>
                <p className="large-card-body text-[#1a1a1a]">
                  In the above example, the transaction cost $100 could mean the
                  difference between profit or loss for the company. Even for a
                  profitable business, the expected margins would be less than
                  actuals.
                </p>
                <p className="large-card-body text-[#1a1a1a]">
                  Some of these costs may be unavoidable, but clear disclosure
                  can allow you to understand what these hidden charges are and
                  their impact on your sales or revenue, so you can take
                  measures to minimize their effect on your business finances.

                <h4>Common Types of Hidden Charges </h4>
                <p className="large-card-body text-[#1a1a1a]">
                  International payment transfers are processed broadly in a
                  four-body payment system with a lot of intermediaries in
                  between to facilitate the transactions. The intermediaries
                  have their processing fees in addition to the conversion
                  costs. There may be other costs associated with availing this
                  facility based on the payment method of choice, such as
                  account opening fees, or withdrawal costs.

                  <span>Exchange rate markups</span>
                </p>
                <p className="large-card-body text-[#1a1a1a]">
                  Exchange rate markups occur when financial institutions offer
                  rates that differ from the mid-market rate. The difference
                  between the offered and mid-market rates represents the markup
                  and acts as a hidden fee. Typically, this ranges from 2% to 5%
                  of the transaction amount.

                <p className="large-card-body text-[#1a1a1a]">
                  Banks and money transfer services often charge fees and
                  commissions for facilitating international transfers. These
                  fees can vary widely depending on the service provider and the
                  transfer amount but are usually in the range of $15 to $50.

                <p className="large-card-body text-[#1a1a1a]">
                  Correspondent banks act as intermediaries in international
                  money transfers. While their role is vital for facilitating
                  cross-border transactions, they may charge fees for their
                  services. Depending on the ticket size, this may be anywhere
                  between $15 â€“ $30.

                  Depending on the mode of payment, there is an additional set
                  up or account opening charge associated. The account opening
                  process typically involves charges for documentation,
                  verification, and processing. Additionally, some banks may
                  require a minimum deposit or maintain a monthly average
                  balance, which may vary based on the type of account and the
                  bank&apos;s policies.

                  For cards in India, this ranges from INR 500 to 10000
                  depending on the bank. Most multicurrency accounts via banks
                  or payment platforms have a minimum balance requirement.
                  Usually this is to account for currency exchange volatility.
