                <p>
                  Amazon regularly updates its fee structures, and the new year
                  brings some significant changes for U.S. sellers. Started in
                  January 2024, sellers had to face new adjustments to both
                  referral fees and fulfillment costs.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Amazon updated its referral fees, a percentage of each
                  product’s total sales price. Effective from January 15, 2024,
                  these changes vary across different product categories.
                  Sellers must reassess pricing strategies to maintain profit
                  margins under the new fee structure.{" "}

                  This year brought some notable updates to FBA fulfillment
                  fees, referral fees, and storage fees. Sellers need to plan

                  Amazon introduced a few key updates to FBA fees in 2024 for

                      The referral fees for certain categories, depending on
                      product types, have been adjusted in 2024. New rates apply
                      to categories like apparel, electronics, and home goods.{" "}

                      Monthly and long-term storage fees have increased,
                      especially for items that remain unsold for long periods.
                      FBA sellers need to manage their inventory more

                  Amazon adjusted its fulfillment fees based on the product’s

                  If you have stock sitting too long in Amazon’s warehouses,
                  expect aged inventory surcharges to hit harder this year.
                  However, the New Selection Program incentivizes sellers to
                  bring in fresh products by offering discounts on storage fees

                  Amazon’s fulfillment centers, sellers will see changes in
                  removal and disposal fees. Manual processing fees have also

                <h5 className="common-h5-heading">Referral Fees </h5>
                <p>
                  Amazon’s referral fees are a commission based on the total
                  sales price of a product. This percentage varies across
                  categories, so it’s essential to know exactly how much you’ll
                  pay for each sale.{" "}
                </p>
                <p>
                  Effective from January 2024, several product categories saw an
                  increase in referral fees. This may have impacted the
                  profitability of certain products if not accounted for in your
                  pricing strategy.{" "}

                  While Referral fees define how much you ought to pay for your

                  Sellers who handle their own fulfillment face a different set
                  of costs compared to FBA sellers. Let’s learn more about these
                  fees:{" "}

                <h5 className="common-h5-heading">Fees Exclusive to FBM Sellers </h5>
                <p>
                  While FBM sellers save on their Amazon fulfillment fees, they
                  must cover shipping, handling, and storage themselves. These
                  costs can add up quickly, especially for larger or heavier
                  items.{" "}
                </p>
                <p>
                  FBM might seem cheaper on the surface, but the time and
                  resources required for self-fulfillment can often outweigh the
                  costs saved. FBA streamlines operations by offering
                  fulfillment, returns, and customer service under one roof.{" "}
                </p>
                <p>
                  Let’s consider a specific product—say a mid-sized home
                  appliance. For FBM, you’d pay for warehouse storage, packing
                  materials, and shipping fees, while FBA would charge for
                  Fulfillment and storage fees. It is important to analyze which
                  model results in greater profit.{" "}

                  To handle the complexities of Amazon&apos;s FBA fees, leveraging
                  specialized tools is crucial. Amazon&apos;s fee calculator offers a
                  basic overview, but third-party tools like Jungle Scout
                  provide a more in-depth analysis. These platforms track how
                  fees, including fulfillment and storage costs, impact your
                  margins. They also help identify opportunities for price
                  adjustments and more efficient inventory management. Effective
                  use of these tools can ensure that your pricing strategy
                  remains profitable even with fluctuating fees.{" "}

                  fees tied to product size, weight, and category, allowing
                  sellers to better anticipate costs. This tool also tracks
