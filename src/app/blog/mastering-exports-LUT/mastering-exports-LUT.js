                                        Undertaking (LUT). All registered exporters who are currently exporting or intend to start their export
                                        journey are required to submit Letter of Undertaking on the GST portal. This enables them to export

                                        Under the GST regime, all exports are subject to IGST, which can later be reclaimed via a refund
                                        against the tax paid. An LUT (Letter of Undertaking) spares exporters the effort of pursuing a refund
                                        and eliminates the blocking of funds by way of tax payments.
