                                             The RoSCTL scheme provides exporters with a rebate on State Taxes and Levies, which includes VAT on

                                             used for electricity generation, and inputs for the transportation sector. The rebate for Central Taxes
                                             and Levies includes central excise duty on transportation fuel, embedded Central Goods and Services

                                             The scheme was initially launched on March 7, 2019, with approval from the Union Cabinet until March
                                             31, 2020. Subsequently, the scheme was further approved until March 31, 2024, with an extension
                                             being announced till March 31, 2026. This ensures a stable policy framework crucial for long-term trade
