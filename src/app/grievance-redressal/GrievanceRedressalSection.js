This framework gives an overview of the transaction lifecycle of PayGlocal system and handles issues faced by customers and merchants separately, with resolution guidelines specified for each dispute type. The customer/merchant is expected to read and understand the dispute type and resolution ownership of their grievance to receive appropriate redressal support from PayGlocal.</p>

                <p className="common-body1-text custom-text-grey900">When a customer initiates a transaction, it is first approved by the payment processing engine and then proceeds to get authorization from the customer for funds to be deducted from their account. Once the transaction has been authorized, it is sent for capture by the processing engine, failing which the transaction is reversed and the amount is returned to the customer account. If the customer initiates refund for any transaction, the captured transaction is then sent for refund processing.</p>
                <p className="common-body1-text custom-text-grey900">Based on this transaction lifecycle, PayGlocal has identified possible issues/ disputes that could arise with the customers or merchants and outlined a dispute resolution framework that acts as a guide to support the grievance redressal process.</p>
